# NFC-uid-Reader-Display

**Status:** âœ… Active Development 

An application designed to display NFC UID information with an easy-to-use graphical interface. This app minimizes to the Windows system tray and allows quick access and control.

---

## Features
- **Real-time UID Display:** Shows NFC UID information when an NFC tag is scanned.
- **System Tray Support:** Minimizes to the Windows hidden icons, making it accessible yet unobtrusive.
- **Quick Actions:** Easily show or exit the app from the system tray.

---

## Compatibility

This application has been tested with the **ACS ACR122U** NFC reader, but it should work with any PC/SC-compliant smart card reader that supports the ISO/IEC 7816 standard. This includes most smart card readers available on the market, as long as they follow the PC/SC protocol for communication with NFC and smart cards.

For best results, make sure to use a reader that supports:
- **PC/SC Protocol**: Ensures compatibility with the application.
- **ISO/IEC 7816 Standard**: Required for communicating with contact smart cards.

Feel free to report any compatibility issues or feedback if you encounter them with other readers.
